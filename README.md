Goal : Doing the various operations on the stock market yearly data

The project done on Cloudera Quickstart VM 5.10 CDH.

Note : Original data was divided into 5 csv files and total it was 1.9 GB data.  While sorting/shuffling it was running out of memory issue.  So I further checked the operations on only 1 file out of 5.  However it also failed with same issue.  Hence took part of 1 st input file and performed the operations on it.

Intention is to run the commands on the small set of data SUCCESSFULLY.
